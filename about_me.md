			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Hi! My name is Leonardo. I am a 23 yo Data Science student with a degree in Physics: I do like to study and learn cool stuff. ðŸ¤“</p>
		<p>My background is nice, but nothing too fancy: scientific Italian High School, exchange year in the USA and then Uni. Always studied with, not to brag, quite good results, even if sometimes pulling some all-nighters. ðŸ˜ª</p>
		<p>Nowadays I like to delve into Data Science and AI stuff: ML algorithms, statistical modelling of phenomena and even crazier stuff, like Quantum ML. I could write boring stuff all day, but check out my <a href="http://localhost:4000/projects.html">projects</a> to see for yourself! ðŸ˜„</p>

			<h3>What I'm currently doing</h3>
		</header>
		<p>Obviously, still studying, even if not for too much: I should graduate around Fall 2021. </p>
		<p>I have also started a collaboration with prof. Kato, of Chuo University, on Affective Computing. </p>
		<p>And, as a plus, I'm trying to expand my knowledge of QML and, maybe, submit some paper about it (keep watching for me on this! ðŸ˜‰).</p>
