			<h2>Quantum Machine Learning</h2>
		</header>
		<p>With two great friends, Pietro Bonardi and Davide Badalotti, I developed a review and primer of modern Quantum Machine Learning. </p>
        <p>
        We also tried to not only show the theoretical aspect of it, but some cool Python libraries which allow for simple QML techniques.

			<h2>Advise Only</h2>
		</header>
		<p>A financial consulting firm needed help to cluster costumers: we tried to use hierarchical clusterings and dimensionality projections to find valuable patterns and make them understandable.</p>
        <p>
        Check out our slides (in Italian, sorry ðŸ˜”) and the project repo if you want. We also developed an App for it, which you can find in the repo below.

			<h2>How Tube Popular</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Put together web scraping, distributed cloud computing and cool visualizations: that's what this project is all about.</p>
        <p>
        Give a look at the repo, a paper about it and our cool visualization. I also leave the handbook we presented to repeat the project: it should give an idea of the complexity of our endeavour.

			<h2>Glitches Classification in the Planck/HFI experiment using Neural Networks</h2>
		</header>
		<p>This is the end of my 3-years long B.Sc. in Physics: a data analysis, mostly using Python, where I cleaned and hand-labelled the satellite data, used to then trained a specific Convolutional Neural Networks. Nothing too fancy, but it was cool and it taught me so much about Machine Learning and its endless possibilities.</p>

			<h2>Just News</h2>

		<p>A state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing project. Like, really state of the art: the main technique used, called CADE, is a revolutionary method just published by a professor at Bicocca. ðŸ¤“</p>
        <p>
        I have some slides and the repo on this one.

			<h2>Chinese Social Credit System</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I developed, with Mr. Pietro Bonardi, a nice review of everything known, which is not too much, about the Chinese Social Credit System, a dystopian thing implemented by the CPP where people are forbidden services if they "do not behave well". If you do not know anything about the subject, it is an interesting read. ðŸ˜‡</p>

			<h2>Mushroom Classification</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Very simple project: develop some classification tasks on the famous Mushroom Dataset. The project was done using KNIME, which, I do not want to hide it, I found to be quite restrictive to work with. Still, the paper is somewhat interesting as to how make some baseline ML classifications. If, for some reason, you are interested in the KNIME workflow we developed, hit me up! ðŸ¤—</p>
